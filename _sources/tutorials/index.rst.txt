This tutorial generates an arbitrary code (here an m-sequence) and shows different kinds of event definitions.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This getting started tutorial shows an example of how to use the PyntBCI library for analysing code-modulated responses. This tutorial makes use of a small dataset of EEG data, recorded from one participant during a single session. This data is already minimally preprocessed following a spectral filter with a band-pass at 2-30 Hz and a downsample from 2 kHz to 240 Hz. The stimuli that were shown are a circularly shifted modulated Gold code (shift register length 6, shift between stimuli 2 bits), presented at 60 Hz. The participant focused on each of the 32 stimuli once in a 4x8 matrix speller, where each presentation lasted 4.2 seconds (2 code cycles) after a 0.8 second cue.">
