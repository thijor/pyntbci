PyntBCI
=======

Python Noise-Tagging Brain-Computer interface (PyntBCI) is a Python library for the noise-tagging brain-computer
interface (BCI) project developed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University,
Nijmegen, the Netherlands. PyntBCI contains various signal processing steps and machine learning algorithms for BCIs
that make use of evoked responses of the electroencephalogram (EEG), specifically code-modulated responses such as the
code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP).
